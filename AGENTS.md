# AGENTS.md

Agent guidance for the `@echecs/fen` package — FEN parser/serialiser.

See the root `AGENTS.md` for workspace-wide conventions.

**Backlog:** tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mormubis/fen/issues).

---

## Project Overview

Parses FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation) strings into `Position` objects and
serialises them back. Default export `parse()` never throws — returns `null` on
failure. Named export `stringify()` always succeeds.

API mirrors `@echecs/trf`.

---

## Similar Libraries

Use these to cross-check output when testing:

- [`chess.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess.js) — includes FEN
  parsing/serialisation as part of its full chess engine.
- [`chessops`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chessops) — TypeScript chess
  library with FEN read/write support.
- [`chess-fen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess-fen) — standalone immutable
  FEN manipulation library.
- [`@chess-fu/fen-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chess-fu/fen-parser) —
  lightweight regex-based FEN parser.

## Dependency Graph

## FEN Format

Six space-separated fields:

1. Piece placement (rank 8 → rank 1, `/` separated)
2. Active color (`w`/`b`)
3. Castling rights (`KQkq` or `-`)
4. En passant square (`e3` or `-`)
5. Halfmove clock (integer)
6. Fullmove number (integer)

---

## Validation

Input validation is mostly provided by TypeScript's strict type system at
compile time. There is no runtime validation library — the type signatures
enforce correct usage. Do not add runtime type-checking guards (e.g. `typeof`
checks, assertion functions) unless there is an explicit trust boundary.

---

## Architecture Notes

- **ESM-only** — the package ships only ESM. Do not add a CJS build.
- Use `.js` extensions on all relative imports (NodeNext resolution).

---

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm lint
```

## Release Protocol

Step-by-step process for releasing a new version. CI auto-publishes to npm when
`version` in `package.json` changes on `main`.

1. **Verify the package is clean:**

   ```bash
   pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
   ```

   Do not proceed if any step fails.

2. **Decide the semver level:**
   - `patch` — bug fixes, internal refactors with no API change
   - `minor` — new features, new exports, non-breaking additions
   - `major` — breaking changes to the public API

3. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** following
   [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format:

   ```markdown
   ## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added

   - …

   ### Changed

   - …

   ### Fixed

   - …

   ### Removed

   - …
   ```

   Include only sections that apply. Use past tense.

4. **Update `README.md`** if the release introduces new public API, changes
   usage examples, or deprecates/removes existing features.

5. **Bump the version:**

   ```bash
   npm version <major|minor|patch> --no-git-tag-version
   ```

6. **Commit and push:**

   ```bash
   git add package.json CHANGELOG.md README.md
   git commit -m "release: @echecs/fen@x.y.z"
   git push
   ```

   **The push is mandatory.** The release workflow only triggers on push to
   `main`. A commit without a push means the release never happens.

7. **CI takes over:** GitHub Actions detects the version bump, runs format →
   lint → test, and publishes to npm.

Do not manually publish with `npm publish`.
